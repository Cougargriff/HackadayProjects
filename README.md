# HackadayProjects
 Node.js app that uses Hackaday's API to display projects

## How to get started
The server runs on node.js so you must have node and npm installed.

To install the dependencies,
> npm install 

This project uses the dotenv node module to add variables to our environment.
You will need a .env file with the necessary information to run the server.
Here is a sample file,

```
  // .env
  API_KEY={YOUR API KEY HERE}
  API_URL=https://api.hackaday.io/v1/
```

To run the project,
> npm start
